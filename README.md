# StockControlSystem

This project saw the creation of a stock control interface that reads and writes from multiple .txt files to monitor and update stock levels for a shop scenario that sells beverages. The product code, item description and item price is stored in one text file called ProductData.txt and the product code and item quantity is stored in a different text file called StockData.txt
